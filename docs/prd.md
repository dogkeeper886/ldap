## 1. Executive Summary

This Product Requirements Document outlines the implementation of a production-ready LDAP server deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to support WiFi authentication testing with RUCKUS One Access Points. The solution will provide a secure, scalable LDAP directory service using Docker containerization, automated TLS certificate management, and comprehensive user attribute support for access control testing scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Docker-based OpenLDAP server deployment on existing GCP VM
- TLS-secured LDAP service (LDAPS on port 636)
- Automated Let's Encrypt certificate management
- Test user database with RUCKUS One-compatible attributes
- Comprehensive authentication testing framework

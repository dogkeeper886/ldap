## Session Summary

**Techniques Used:** 
1. First Principles Thinking - Identified core requirements
2. Solution Architecture - Selected production-ready path
3. Requirements Analysis - Mapped RUCKUS One integration needs
4. General Purpose Test Case Design - Created flexible test structure

**Total Ideas Generated:** 25+ concepts across infrastructure, security, and testing

## Session Progress

### Technique 1: First Principles Thinking
*Breaking down the fundamentals of the LDAP deployment*

#### Context Discovered:
- WiFi access point authentication testing scenario
- AP requires LDAP authentication
- TLS connection likely required (LDAPS on port 636 or StartTLS on 389)

#### Core Requirements Identified:
- TLS/SSL secured connection required
- Need public CA certificate (Let's Encrypt viable option)
- Understanding difference between LDAP and Active Directory
- Existing infrastructure: Domain name available
- Existing infrastructure: GCP VM with fixed IP running Docker

#### Key Insights:
- **LDAP vs Active Directory:**
  - LDAP = Protocol/standard for accessing directory services
  - AD = Microsoft's directory service that speaks LDAP (plus more)
  - Pure LDAP servers: OpenLDAP, 389 Directory Server, ApacheDS
  - AD provides LDAP + Kerberos + DNS + Group Policy + more
  - For WiFi auth testing, pure LDAP is likely sufficient

### Technique 2: Solution Architecture - Production-Ready Path

#### Selected Approach: Path 2 - Production-Ready Setup
- Docker Compose with OpenLDAP + Certbot
- Automated cert renewal  
- Proper data persistence
- Username/password authentication
- Custom attribute parsing for WiFi access control

#### Core Features Identified:
1. **Authentication Method**: Username/password (simple bind)
2. **Attributes Required**: Custom attributes for WiFi access control
3. **Certificate Management**: Let's Encrypt with auto-renewal
4. **Deployment**: Docker Compose on existing GCP VM
5. **Persistence**: Volume mounts for LDAP data and certificates

### Technique 3: Requirements Analysis - RUCKUS One Integration

#### RUCKUS One Identity Mapping Requirements:
Based on the RUCKUS One IdP configuration page, we need these LDAP attributes:

**Required Standard Attributes:**
- `displayName` → Display name of the user
- `mail` or `email` → User's email address  
- `telephoneNumber` or `phone` → User's phone number
- Additional custom attributes (configurable)

**LDAP Schema Mapping:**
```
RUCKUS Field     →  Standard LDAP Attribute
displayName      →  displayName (or cn)
email           →  mail
phone           →  telephoneNumber
Custom Attr 1   →  (depends on use case - could be department, employeeType, etc.)
```

**Test User Examples:**
- User 1: Basic employee with standard access
- User 2: Guest with limited access
- User 3: Admin with full access
- Different attribute values to test access policies

### Technique 4: General Purpose Test Case Design

#### Universal Test Setup:
Create a flexible LDAP structure that covers most common testing scenarios

**Base Test Users Configuration:**
```
All users will have:
- displayName (required by RUCKUS)
- mail (required by RUCKUS)
- telephoneNumber (required by RUCKUS)
- department (Custom Attribute 1 - for access control testing)
- employeeType (additional attribute for policy testing)
- memberOf (group membership for role-based access)
```

**Proposed Test User Set:**
1. **test-user-01**: Standard employee (department=IT, employeeType=Full-Time)
2. **test-user-02**: Guest user (department=Guest, employeeType=Visitor)
3. **test-user-03**: Admin user (department=IT, employeeType=Admin)
4. **test-user-04**: Contractor (department=External, employeeType=Contractor)
5. **test-user-05**: VIP user (department=Executive, employeeType=Full-Time)

**Flexible Attribute Design:**
- Use `department` as Custom Attribute 1 in RUCKUS
- Can be repurposed for any categorization needed
- Easy to add more attributes without schema changes
- Standard LDAP attributes ensure compatibility

## Outcomes & Next Steps

### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Technology Stack**: OpenLDAP in Docker with Docker Compose
2. **Security**: Let's Encrypt certificates with automated renewal
3. **Test Strategy**: 5 diverse test users with department-based access control
4. **RUCKUS Integration**: Map department to Custom Attribute 1 for flexible policy testing

### Deliverables Created:
✅ Brainstorming session documentation (this file)
✅ Comprehensive PRD document (docs/prd.md)

### Recommended Next Actions:
1. Review and approve the PRD document
2. Create Docker Compose configuration with OpenLDAP and Certbot
3. Configure DNS records for the domain
4. Implement LDIF files for test user creation
5. Set up monitoring and logging
6. Document RUCKUS One configuration steps

### Questions for Future Sessions:
- Performance requirements under load?
- Backup and disaster recovery needs?
- Integration with other authentication systems?
- Compliance or audit requirements?

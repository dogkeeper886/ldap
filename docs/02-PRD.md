# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-09-08  
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary  
**Participant:** Jack  

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Three-Project Architecture: Shared Certbot + Independent LDAP + FreeRADIUS Docker Servers

**Session Goals:** Separate certbot from LDAP reference, create standalone certificate management, build independent FreeRADIUS server

**Techniques Used:** First Principles Analysis, Reference Architecture Study, Port Conflict Resolution

**Total Ideas Generated:** 15 core implementation patterns identified

### Key Themes Identified:
- Three independent projects with shared certificate distribution
- Standalone certbot project handling multi-domain certificates
- Docker CP-based certificate copying to avoid permission issues
- Makefile-driven build workflows for each project
- Independent service deployment with shared certificate lifecycle

## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Analysis - 45 minutes

**Description:** Breaking down the LDAP reference architecture to identify reusable automation components

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Three independent projects: Standalone Certbot + LDAP + FreeRADIUS
2. Multi-domain certificate acquisition (ldap.example.com,radius.example.com)
3. Docker CP certificate distribution to avoid cross-container permission issues
4. Shared certbot project on port 80 serving both services
5. Certificate copying workflow: Certbot container → Host filesystem → Service build contexts
6. Each project handles its own certificate copying from certbot container
7. Individual project Make workflows: `make copy-certs && make build-tls`
8. Build-time certificate inclusion in Docker images (not runtime volumes)
9. Independent service deployment and lifecycle management
10. Environment-based multi-domain configuration
11. TLS certificate file permissions automation (644 for certs)
12. Certificate renewal automation with service rebuild triggers
13. Port conflict resolution through centralized certbot
14. Project-specific certificate build contexts
15. Unified certificate lifecycle across multiple services

**Insights Discovered:**
- Port 80 conflict prevents co-located LDAP and FreeRADIUS certbot containers
- Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 challenge requires port 80 - cannot use alternatives like 8080
- LDAP reference uses docker cp for certificate distribution to build contexts
- Multi-domain certificates eliminate need for separate certbot instances
- Build-time certificate copying avoids runtime permission complexity
- Make workflows enable reproducible certificate distribution patterns
- Docker CP commands extract certs from running containers to host filesystem

**Notable Connections:**
- Three-project separation mirrors microservice architecture principles
- Certificate distribution pattern reusable across any Docker service requiring TLS
- Makefile targets provide consistent interface across projects
- Same certificate files serve both LDAP and FreeRADIUS (SAN certificate)
- Docker build context copying eliminates runtime volume mounting complexity

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities
*Ideas ready to implement now*

1. **Standalone Certbot Project Creation**
   - Description: Extract certbot from LDAP reference into independent project
   - Why immediate: Resolves port 80 conflict, enables multi-domain certificate management
   - Resources needed: LDAP certbot Docker configuration, multi-domain environment setup

2. **Multi-Domain Certificate Configuration**
   - Description: Configure certbot to request SAN certificate for both domains
   - Why immediate: Single certificate serves both LDAP and FreeRADIUS services
   - Resources needed: Domain configuration, Let's Encrypt multi-domain syntax

3. **Docker CP Certificate Distribution**
   - Description: Implement certificate copying from certbot container to project build contexts
   - Why immediate: Proven LDAP pattern, avoids permission issues
   - Resources needed: Copy scripts, project directory structure setup

### Future Innovations
*Ideas requiring development/research*

1. **FreeRADIUS Configuration Automation**
   - Description: Auto-configure FreeRADIUS TLS settings based on certificate availability
   - Development needed: FreeRADIUS config templating, TLS section automation
   - Timeline estimate: 1-2 days

2. **Multi-Domain Certificate Support**
   - Description: Extend beyond single domain to support multiple certificate domains
   - Development needed: Certbot configuration enhancement, config file templating
   - Timeline estimate: 3-5 days

3. **Certificate Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Description: Web interface for certificate status, renewal history, and health
   - Development needed: Web UI development, certificate status API
   - Timeline estimate: 1-2 weeks

### Moonshots
*Ambitious, transformative concepts*

1. **Zero-Configuration RADIUS-as-a-Service**
   - Description: Fully automated FreeRADIUS deployment with domain detection and auto-cert
   - Transformative potential: Eliminates manual RADIUS server setup complexity
   - Challenges to overcome: DNS automation, domain validation, configuration templating

2. **Multi-Protocol Certificate Automation**
   - Description: Unified cert management for RADIUS, LDAP, web services, and more
   - Transformative potential: Single solution for enterprise certificate management
   - Challenges to overcome: Service discovery, configuration abstraction, restart orchestration

### Insights & Learnings
*Key realizations from the session*

- **Architecture Reusability**: LDAP cert automation patterns directly applicable to FreeRADIUS with minimal changes
- **Container Orchestration**: Two-container pattern provides clean separation of concerns between service and certificate management
- **Build vs Runtime Strategy**: LDAP reference uses build-time cert copying for immutable container approach
- **Permission Management**: Critical importance of correct file permissions (644) and ownership for certificate files
- **Environment Parameterization**: .env file approach enables easy development/production environment switching

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Standalone Certbot Project Setup
- **Rationale**: Foundation for all certificate management, resolves port conflicts
- **Next steps**: 
  1. Create `/certbot` directory structure
  2. Extract certbot Docker configuration from LDAP reference
  3. Configure multi-domain certificate acquisition
  4. Each project implements certificate copying from certbot container
  5. Test multi-domain certificate generation
- **Resources needed**: LDAP certbot reference, domain configuration
- **Timeline**: 3-4 hours

#### #2 Priority: LDAP Project Separation
- **Rationale**: Remove certbot dependency, use external certificate source
- **Next steps**:
  1. Modify LDAP docker-compose.yml to remove certbot service
  2. Update Makefile to use external certbot container
  3. Test certificate copying from standalone certbot
  4. Validate LDAP TLS functionality with external certs
- **Resources needed**: LDAP project modification, certificate path updates
- **Timeline**: 2-3 hours

#### #3 Priority: FreeRADIUS Project Creation
- **Rationale**: Primary objective - independent FreeRADIUS with TLS automation
- **Next steps**:
  1. Create `/freeradius` project structure
  2. Create FreeRADIUS Dockerfile with certificate build context
  3. Implement certificate copying script for FreeRADIUS
  4. Configure FreeRADIUS TLS settings
  5. Add test user configuration
  6. Create Makefile with copy-certs and build-tls targets
- **Resources needed**: FreeRADIUS base image, TLS configuration knowledge
- **Timeline**: 6-8 hours

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- **Reference Architecture Analysis**: Examining working LDAP implementation provided clear implementation roadmap
- **First Principles Approach**: Breaking down existing solution into reusable components
- **Constraint Identification**: Clear requirements (test server, public certs, Docker) focused the solution

### Areas for Further Exploration
- **FreeRADIUS TLS Configuration**: Deep dive into FreeRADIUS-specific TLS setup and certificate loading
- **Certificate Renewal Testing**: Validation of automatic renewal and service restart workflow
- **Production Hardening**: Security considerations for production deployment beyond test environment

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **Morphological Analysis**: Systematically explore combinations of FreeRADIUS modules, certificate types, and deployment patterns
- **Assumption Reversal**: Challenge assumptions about required components and explore minimal viable implementations
- **Role Playing**: Consider perspectives of different users (admin, end-user, security auditor) to identify additional requirements

### Questions That Emerged
- **How to coordinate certificate renewal across three independent projects?**
- **Which FreeRADIUS configuration files need certificate path updates?**
- **Does FreeRADIUS require container rebuild for certificate updates?**
- **What is the optimal project directory structure for three independent services?**
- **How should each project handle certificate copying after renewals?**
- **Should each project have independent .env files or shared configuration?**

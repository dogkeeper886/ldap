# project-profile

The one place a downstream project declares its specifics. The shipped commands and
skills state their *intent* and resolve any project-specific value — a path, an ID
scheme, a label, an integration, a format, an audience — **from this file**, instead of
hardcoding it. Customize a workflow by editing this file, not the units.

**How a unit uses it.** Where a command or skill would otherwise bake in a value, it
points at the matching section here (e.g. "create the *plan* label — see
project-profile → Labels"). The values below are the **defaults**: they reproduce this
repo's current behaviour, so a project that changes nothing behaves exactly as it does
now. Adoption is opt-in — change a line here and every unit follows.

**Two wiring styles, and when each applies.** A **skill** points at this file at each point
of use — it is read on its own, with no rule loaded beside it. A **command** may show a
value inline as an illustrated default; its group rule (`.claude/rules/*.md`) carries the
"these resolve from the profile" statement for the whole group, so the pointer is not
repeated line by line. Both are correct. Which one applies is decided by whether the unit
is read together with its rule — not by preference.

**What belongs here vs. not.** This file is for **declarative** customization — a value
or a list. A whole **procedure** (e.g. how to publish to Confluence and review the
render) is *not* a value; it belongs in its own project-owned skill, never crammed into
a general unit. Lists → here; procedures → a project skill. This is the rules files'
"what this owns vs. what it hands off" boundary, made concrete.

The same line binds the **units**. A value this file can restate is safe for a unit to show
inline; a *procedure* never is — how drift is detected, how files are laid out. No value can
override a procedure, so a project that does it another way is forced to edit the shipped
unit, and its repo then reads as drifted when it was only working around us. State the goal;
let this file or the project's own layer name the mechanism.

## Paths

- stories dir: `docs/stories/`
- diagrams dir: `docs/images/` (SVG source + rendered PNG)
- story format contract: `docs/stories/README.md`

## ID schemes

- story id: `STORY-XXX` (zero-padded sequential, e.g. `STORY-001`)
- title prefixes: `[STORY-XXX] Plan` · `[STORY-XXX] <task>`

## Labels

Names the workflow uses; colours where the workflow pins one (`#hex`), otherwise the
project's choice.

- plan: `plan` (`#5319e7`)
- priority: `priority:high` · `priority:medium` · `priority:low`
- type: `feature` · `enhancement` · `bug` · `docs`
- status: `status:in-progress` · `status:needs-review` · `status:blocked`

## Linking & branch

- story back-reference (in titles/bodies): `[STORY-XXX]`
- plan back-reference (task → plan): `Part of #<plan>`
- issue closure (PR → issue): `Fixes #N` / `Closes #N`
- feature branch name: `issue-<N>-<slug>`

## Git

- default branch: *derive it* (`gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name`), don't assume `main`
- merge strategy: `--merge` (preserve history; switch to `--squash` only if the project requires)

## Docs & diagrams

- README output: `README.md`
- diagram policy: SVG source committed + rendered to PNG (no Mermaid / inline diagram blocks)
- diagrams dir: `docs/images/` (SVG source + rendered PNG) — also under Paths

## Reports

The words a gate report uses. The contract itself — the questions a report answers and
why — is `.claude/rules/agent-report.md`; a unit resolves the wording from here.

- verdict vocabulary: `PASS` · `REVISE` · `HAND BACK`
- extra verdict (artifact review only): `CUT` — the artifact duplicates another or does
  nothing useful; propose removal
- section names: `Verdict` · `Findings` · `Checked` · `Not done` · `Unresolved` ·
  `Trace` · `Next`
- empty-section marker: `none` (a section with nothing to report says so; it is not dropped)
- finding columns: `# · severity · location · what's wrong · smallest fix`
- formats by medium: chat session → plain text, tables, ASCII diagrams · document or
  issue → whatever renders there. For a *published* human-read doc the diagram policy
  under Docs & diagrams applies instead.

## Review semantics

- canonical format (source of truth): `markdown`
- live integrations: `GitHub` — tools the project genuinely uses; coupling to one
  listed here is correct, not drift. (A downstream adds its own, e.g. Jira, Confluence,
  TestLink.)
- deliverable (triggers a paired review): a unit that *produces or changes* an output —
  by name (`create-`/`sync-`/`publish-`/`draft-`/`init-`) or as a producing gerund skill
  (`planning-…`, `drafting-…`)
- audience (human-read docs): engineers and newcomers
